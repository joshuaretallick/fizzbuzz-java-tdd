# fizzbuzz-java-tdd

For this exercise I am doing the classic "FizzBuzz" exercise but using Java and jUnit.
I have only just started learning Java this week (and JUnit today) so I am expecting this to be a little clunky and would like feedback on refactoring and tidying up code.
I would also note that the @displayNames only show up when the tests are run in intelliJ meaning the testing isnt very descriptive when it is run from the command line.  I haven't had a chance to figure this out yet, but maybe it isn't even a thing.

To run this example:

Clone the project

If you have Gradle already installed enter 'gradle clean test' to see tests passing

If you don't have it then it will need to be installed via Homebrew.

If opened via intelliJ enter CTRL + R to run the tests, please be sure to run the tests with intelliJ and not Gradle if you want to see the expressive test messages.
